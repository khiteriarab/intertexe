Add a Shopping Intelligence / Scanner page with these features:

1. Three input methods:

Camera scan (for mobile users to photograph price tags)
Photo upload
Paste a product URL from any retailer (Nordstrom, SSENSE, Farfetch, Net-a-Porter, brand sites, etc.)
2. Two API endpoints needed:

POST /api/scan-tag — Takes a base64 image, sends it to OpenAI Vision (gpt-4o-mini) to read the brand name, product name, and price from the tag photo.

POST /api/scan-url — Takes a product URL, scrapes the page, sends the text content to OpenAI to extract brand name, product name, price, and material composition.

3. Both endpoints then do the same thing:

Search the designers table in Supabase for the brand (by slug and fuzzy name match) — this covers all 11,000+ brands
Search the products table for that brand's verified products
Run a "web intelligence" step: send the brand/product info to OpenAI asking for composition analysis, quality assessment, price range, which retailers carry it, sustainability notes, and an honest verdict on whether it's worth the price
Find "better alternatives" — query products with higher natural_fiber_percent in the same category from other brands
Return everything in one response
4. The results page shows (top to bottom):

Tag/URL identified: brand name, product name, price
Brand card from our directory (logo, name, description, if we have it)
Brand rating if we have products (average natural fiber %, rated Exceptional/Excellent/Good/Caution)
Internet Intelligence section: likely composition with natural fiber % bar, quality assessment, verdict, price range, other retailers, sustainability notes
Verified products grid from that brand (up to 6)
Higher Quality Alternatives grid — similar items from other brands with better natural fiber content
5. Environment:

Uses the same Supabase (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) with products and designers tables
Uses OpenAI (OPENAI_API_KEY) for vision analysis, page scraping analysis, and web intelligence
The products table has: id, brand_slug, brand_name, name, price, composition, natural_fiber_percent, category, image_url, url, approved
The designers table has: id, slug, name, logo_url, website, description, rating
