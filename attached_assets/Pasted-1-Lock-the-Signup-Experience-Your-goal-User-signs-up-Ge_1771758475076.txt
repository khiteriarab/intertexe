1. Lock the Signup Experience

Your goal:
	•	User signs up
	•	Gets welcome email
	•	Lands in product immediately

Next things to confirm inside Replit:
	•	After signup → redirect to /quiz
	•	After quiz → show results
	•	Prompt: “Save your results by creating an account” if not logged in
	•	If already logged in → auto-save

This ensures:

➡️ Accounts = tied to value
➡️ Not random signups

Tell Replit:

After successful signup, redirect users to /quiz.
If user completes quiz while not logged in, store results temporarily and prompt account creation to save results.

✅ 2. Make Designers Page Pull From Supabase (No Mock Data)

Right now Replit still has mock arrays.

Tell Replit:

Remove all mock designer arrays and ensure Designers page fetches from Supabase designers table where status = ‘live’. If none exist, display empty state message.

This is essential for scale.

⸻

✅ 3. Add “Favorites” Saving

Tell Replit:

Logged-in users can click “Save” on a designer. This creates a row in favorites table. Favorites page shows user’s saved designers.

This is retention.

✅ 4. Lock the Monetization Model

Here’s the cleanest structure for you:

Free Tier
	•	Browse designers
	•	Take quiz
	•	See top-level % material quality

Paid Tier ($19/month later)
	•	AI recommendations
	•	Deep fabric breakdowns
	•	Personalized edits
	•	Saved collections
	•	Alerts when high-quality items drop

Tell Replit:

Add subscription gating so AI recommendations require active subscription. Browsing designers and quiz remain free.

You do NOT need to build payments yet. Just structure for it.

⸻

✅ 5. Add AI Recommendations Hook

Tell Replit:

Use OpenAI API to generate recommendations based on quiz results and saved favorites. Store response in database and display on user dashboard.

⸻

✅ 6. SEO & Indexing (Critical for Income)

Tell Replit:

Ensure every designer page has SEO-friendly meta title and description using designer name.

This is how you’ll eventually rank on Google.

⸻

✅ 7. Analytics

Tell Replit:

Add basic analytics to track: signups, quiz completions, favorites saved.

Without this you’re blind.
